What is one piece of advice you have for aspiring GIS professionals?
20 years I ago I was told not to mistake making maps for real work (ArcView3).  Within my ag sector I've seen that attitude lessen and but now it seems to be regaining strength - mostly as a way to shit on GIS technicians as task monkeys to be outsourced to unskilled gig work.
Absolutely learn a scripting language. This pays dividends in so many ways.
"Actually learn your shit, don’t just learn how to make maps "
Always be looking for your next job. The lag time on a job hunt is brutal.
Always learn something new.
Always try and learn new things
"Automate what you can, spend time make data outputs look as nice as possible (tables, reports, etc)"
"be a sponge, learn as much as you can"
Be a sponge. Absorb all the knowledge you can. Be curious about the profession and technology.
Be adaptable and keep on learning. Pay attention to the details
"Be comfortable with Python and SQL. With Python you don’t have to be a computer scientist, but it really helps if you are “code literate” "
"Be committed to always wanting to learn. GIS should really not be your lone focus professionally. Look into things like data analysis or programming to supplement your GIS learning as these will help you in your career. Also don't look at ESRI as the central source for everything GIS. They do some good things, but the GIS community would be better as a whole if they had some decent competition within the industry. "
Be curious and inquisitive. Rarely does your listed experience line up with expectations on the job. Its innovation and improvisation and ability to learn and adapt which really helps.
Be Flexible!
Be helpful 
Be interested in lots of things so that you can convey all kind of different information on a map in a way that makes the most sense for the data
Be open to learning new things
Be open to learning new things.
Be passionate. Enjoy the technology and insights the data provides 
Be patient and keep applying. 
"Be patient. Learn and grow your skills. Just because you went to college doesn't mean you ""deserve"" $100k a year salary. It has to be earned."
"Be proactive, look for opportunities, make yourself known"
"Be professional, Be willing to say no, Beware of scope creep. "
"Be willing to learn new technologies. The field changes constantly and you need to keep up with it, often on your own time."
Be willing to relocate in pursuit of a GIS job. Nothing is permanent. You’ll be better for it.
Become a subject matter expert in some other field and use gis
Broaden your skill set as much as you can.  Make time for training/small projects to spark creativity for future work.
Build skills in programming at an early age.
Canadian army pays well
Check for GIS positions outside of expected fields. Careers may exist in areas you never would have expected.
Code/cartography/FOSS
Coding helps. Continuing education is important to keep up with developments in the field.
"Collect skills, not courses/education"
Combine GIS with another interest/field
"Consider the business-oriented roles in GIS. Consulting, project management, etc. "
Continue learning and evolving 
Continue to focus on learning new skills and technologies.
Continue to learn and keep your skills relevant.
Continuing developing new skills inside and outside of GIS
Contribute to Open Source projects
"Create a portfolio, learn to code lol, reach out to everyone."
Critical thinking will get you far
"Decide if you want to be a programmer, if not, don't go into GIS"
Demand a living wage and fantastic benefits.
"Develop interest in specified application of GIS over time, Build portfolio of outputs (i.e: maps, results, coding scripts, etc...) for presentation, Take advantage of training opportunities "
Diversify
Diversify and know how to code in at least Python
Diversify your skills. Cloud and IT specific to GIS is where it's at.
Do GIS not land surveying. I got out of it and started studying electrical engineering but i would love to get into GIS. 
"Do not get a degree in just GIS! Major in a specific field of interest, get a GIS cert."
Do not limit yourself when it comes to career paths: stay hungry for new information and stay agile with your skillset. 
Do research what kind of jobs/projects you can apply for/are in your area that involves GIS in advance before you pick GIS ffs or you'll have a bad time chasing people and acting more like a sales person than a GIS specialist...(especially true if you're not from the US/western europe or more developed countries)
Do things better
Do your own homework 
"Don't act like server administration, front-end development, back-end systems, databases and IT are ""someone else's job.""  They are YOUR JOB.  THE BELL TOLLS FOR THEE"
"Don't ask, don't wait to go beyond your duties. No one is going to help you achieve your goals."
Don't be afraid to code! Maybe you will end up liking it :)
"Don't focus on ""GIS"", especially desktop GIS. It's just a tool, one of many that you can use on your data."
"Don't give up guys, GIS is way cooler than it sounds in university classes. "
Don't go to graduate school unless you want more coding experience.
"Don't lie during a job interview or pad your resume with something you wouldn't be comfortable doing on a day to day basis. If you say you know python during the interview and get hired, but only watched someone explain a script once and the new job asked you to create a script from scratch, you're going to have a hard time and your new employers will start to question what else you might have ""embellished."" Be honest about what you know and don't know. It'll benefit everyone in the long run."
"Don't limit yourself too early and just dive in - when you feel over your head, read the docs. Repeat. "
Don't listen to the naysayers.
"Don't mistake an entry level position as a bad thing, you can still learn plenty in that position."
Don't pinhole yourself. Have a decent understanding of a wide range of skills and pick a few you enjoy and run with them. 
Don't waste your time in front of monitors in this low paid industry.
"Don’t be afraid of change. Be flexible, and try your best to stay up to date. And don’t be afraid to push for change in your organization or industry."
Don’t be afraid to move for a job
"Don’t listen to idiots on the internet. Learn to code. Don’t look for a GIS job, look for a job in a field you like where you can do GIS."
Dont forget the soft skills. Being an expert cartographer or geographer is great but dont forget that you need to communicate the work you are doing to those in other departments of professions. A positive and approachable approach in discussion is just as important as technical knowledge....sometimes more (Fake it till you make it!) 
Dont learn exclusively GIS. Try to integrate in other fields.
Double major in CS or subject other than GIS or Geography 
Evolve as GIS is always changing and evolving itself.
"Expect that your job will actually be 4 people's job rolled into one, no one is just a ""gis analyst"" anymore it feels like"
Find a job that you enjoy.
Find someone competent to take care of your GIS server.
find what speaks to you
Focus more on data science. GIS as a whole is being more integrated into the data science community and walling yourself off from that sphere just won't fly anymore. Coding is also becoming non-negotiable to be considered competitive. 
"Focus more on programming and databases. SQL and Python are a great start, C# or Javascript as a followup. FME is becoming common in larger operations. Maps and analysis are the result of most effort, not the premise. To help get in otherwise, it might help to take field work positions such as land surveying or GPS jobs. "
Focus on phenomena/events in which you are interested first and then start exploring data that is available for regions that exhibit the characteristics that intrigue you. 
Get a damn internship. Multiple if possible.
"Get a GIS internship (such as in local government) even if the field isn't completely what you want to work in, as you will still learn valuable, transferrable skills"
"get an education in a field besides GIS - ecology, urban planning, geology, computer science etc"
"Get an internship or entry level job, it's the easiest way to apply GIS. Regional/Local government tends to have a significant technological gap as it relates to GIS and research capability. Creating authoritative, validated datasets of important information for local decision makers is still necessary, even in the world of big (but often dirty) data."
Get an internship while in school
Get familiar with programming/coding early
"Get involved in different kinds of projects as much as possible early on. Learn different platforms, especially cloud based ones and open source. Get involved in field work and data collection when possible. If you find yourself doing redundant work, figure out how to automate it via software tools, functions, or packages/modules. When you get with a working group, figure out where they could benefit from introducing spatial analysis and GIS data and methods."
Get outside of your comfort zone and learn something new. Learn a new technology or just a  new place on the map.
Get smart on data management
"Get some experience in another field, and use GIS as a tool in that field. Also, Python, Python, Python."
"Getting an internship is pretty helpful but not mandatory. If there is a specific line of work you desire (e.g. cartography,) keep striving for it regardless of what people here tell you."
"GIS can be self-taught, taught in one class, or trained on the job. Don't major in it. "
"GIS is a tool to solve problems.  There are no hammer specialists, there are only builders.  Focus on what problems you would like to solve before you pick the tools to solve them.  "
GIS is a tool to support your profession. Protect your hearing.
"Gis is a tool,  not a job"
"GIS is a tool, it should compliment some other skillset or education that you have (development, environmental science, forestry, etc.)"
"GIS is an applied science & career field, but in no way a singular skill. If you're learning Esri-button-clicking, you need to broaden your skills to database management or programming or remote sensing or web development... There aren't many Esri-button-clicking, digitizing, entry level jobs left and they continue to disappear."
"GIS is entry level, you have to be cognizant with your career path forward to step outside of being a ""GIS guy"""
"GIS is just a tool, figure out what you want to use it for/in"
"GIS is not a profession by itself, just a tool"
GIS isn’t the end goal. What are you using it for?
"GIS skills are transferable and useful in almost any field. Find creative ways to practice your skills even if your current work doesn't typically require them. Also, if you learned desktop GIS and want to take it to the next level, learn how to connect web services to your current maps. Better yet, learn how to make and host your own web maps! Also, pick up a programming language!"
Git Gud
"Go north, be prepared to move"
go open source
Go to a school that takes it seriously
Go web dev
Government jobs are an awesome way to start a career!
Have a goal or sub-discipline you want to use GIS to access. 
"Have an accompanying skill set (ecology, surveying, IT, etc)"
having an understanding of programming will make life easier for you. 
"I am an aspiring GIS professional. However, for people like me, one piece of advice I have is to get as much experience as you can with GIS. Try to do internships and do projects in school with mapping."
"i am one, so NA"
I can't give advice as I am still a student
"I was told this by a mentor when I was going through college: Make sure to adopt a broad skillset. GIS is not enough, knowing AutoCad, database technology, and a good helping of Enterprise level IT will  ensure a good path."
"I'm still aspiring, but my advice would be to practice on multiple softwares, so you're familiar with them for employers/internships."
I'm the aspiring GIS professional... But I'd say take a break when your brain stops working on solving a problem
"If possible, negotiate your initial hiring salary/PTO/benefits. With a reasonable number, worst they can say is no. Helpful when future raises/benefits are impacted by life (natural disaster, politics, COVID, etc)."
If you can't get a GIS position right away try working a related position to get industry experience.
"If you're going to pay for 4 years of school, do something else and get a meaningful degree"
Intern
"Internships during college are vital. Don’t forget to think about local, state, and federal governments who all need GIS people. Also I have seen at my work, and I think we will start to see in the community, Data Science concepts and requests creeping in. So learn some of that while you can."
Internships during undergrad are worth their time and then some. Experience will triumph courses almost every time.
"It's a tool, learn how it's best applied. Data is far more important than software."
"It's fun. Coding/scripting is very helpful and useful so if you have the chance to learn, I definitely recommend. "
"It’s just a tool, you almost have to have a supplemental degree these days. "
join or start a union 
Just keep clicking buttons.  I have no formal training in GIS and only learn by Googling and clicking buttons until I break something.
"Keep applying, you'll get your foot in the door."
Keep at it
"Keep going, don't give up. People need maps, they just don't know it yet. "
"Keep it as a hobby if you really love the field. Find ways to give back. For eg. Mapathons, Hotosm, GIScorps "
Keep learning
Keep learning even if your job doesn't require it.
Keep learning!
Keep looking for new things to learn!
Keep moving around. It's no longer your parent's world where you stay with a company from college to retirement. 
"Keep practicing, look up open-source guides. Many are available through universities or old Esri walk through labs."
Keep researching 
Keep up with technology change
"Keeping being eager and willing to learn, it is the best asset"

Learn fields other than GIS - try to get an understanding of how people are using your work rather than narrowly focusing on the geospatial world. 
"Learn good coding practices, experiment with platforms and packages to find what works best for you. Find a good backup system. "
Learn how to program
"Learn how to research and don’t undervalue understanding. Tutorials and specific solutions are useful; but actually understanding the system is critical.

Oh, and don’t mistake GIS as just Esri. "
learn how to work with non-specialists 
Learn methods no buttons
Learn more technical skills than button pressing in ArcGIS
"Learn more than just GIS. Whether it be Python, R, or something not related to GIS entirely. GIS is useful, but nothing to lean on exclusively unless you get lucky."
"Learn multiple complementary skills (e.g., programming, survey methods, etc.)"
Learn Programming

"Learn python; pick a sub speciality field (environment, utilities etc)"
Learn python!! 
Learn scripting and handling large netcdf files.
Learn software development
"Learn some basic coding, not so that you can write python scripts or do anything complex, but because it gets you thinking in an object-oriented manner. Especially for QGIS you can call up so many parameters and variables to take advantage of in small little expressions such as for Atlases and symbology it's really really useful."
Learn some Python
Learn the art of cartography as well as the science
Learn the basics outside of work. Get the specifics from your team to show willing.

Network. Buy bitcoin
Networking 
Never limit yourself to your current technical skills or knowledge/always be learning
Never stop learning 
Never use the default setting for map font/symbology
"no advise, i'm not in GIS yet (i'm a student)"
not knowing what youre doing is normal!
Nothing as I currently am working to get back into GIS
Pay for the $100 personal ArcGIS license and dabble in it.
Pick a job and then become the person who does that in your organization. Own it.
Pick up software development and be aware of the trends in it such as virtualization
Plan the data organization before you start a new project.
Program in area outside of gis. Like build a website or a game. The logic you get from those exercises opens all sorts or ideas for presenting your work. 
Programming
"Programming is the new essay writing; if you can write a good essay, you can write a good program given enough time."
Read through job descriptions before you look at course curricula and don’t obsess over your GPA - industry generally doesn’t care after your first couple of years. 
Remember GIS a tool. Learn how to apply it to different fields/industries that interest you. Also learn python. 
Resources. I'm not learning enough through work
Save your edit as often as you can. 
save your projects and school assignments. It will help with portfolio building. Also for reference of workflows.
Say yes to opportunities to expand knowledge
"Scripting will get you jobs. YOu dont have to become a developer, but automating tasks is key these days!"
"Self learning will be required. Be interdisciplinary. Ensure GIS can be a passion. You will likely need to help educate the organization you work in on GIS capabilities and limitations without good data structure and governance. Network and participate in GIS organizations, associations, and councils. Become more than a tool user, the software will continue get easier to use and lower the bar, you must rise above it to maintain a high profession."
Specialize
"Specialize! That could either mean specializing in programming, or specializing in subject matter. Better yet, you could do both!"
Strong work ethic is key
"Study Computer Science, and get a Masters ASAP! It's easy to get stuck in the lower rungs of the profession"
"Study GIS *and* something else (conservation, IT, hydrology, etc.)"
"Study GIS + something else, not GIS alone"
"Study well the GIS theory, explore software alternatives,  get involved in web programming"
Take chances even if you think there isn't one - I'm at my current full-time position because I applied for an internship where I thought I had zero-chance of even being considered.
Take the tasks no one else wants to do
The earlier you start programming the better!
The field is changing more now than it ever has. Get excited at the potential GIS has to offer.
"The field is vast, and there are multiple examples of how GIS can be utilized and applied."
There are hundreds of different free resources for all types of GIS topics. Seize these opportunities to better yourself now. 
"There are near-infinite sides to GIS; even if you think that there’s no way you can do all the things you want at once... odds are there *is* a way. And if you’re aiming towards GIS, you don’t have to choose between that and another passion...because every field has some use for GIS! Don’t worry too much about the theoretical end goal to start. "
"There are so many sectors to explore, if you don't like one consider another"
There is no aspect of life that GIS can’t be combined with. Everything exists somewhere. Find the interaction with something you’re passionate about. 
"Think about the process overall, and not the software in particular. There is more than one way to skin a cat. For fuck's sake, learn how to write, too."
Think conceptually! How can GIS help people? 
Think outside of the box and try to solve problems and don’t be afraid to take chances with geospatial solutions 
Think outside the box and be innovstive
Think outside the box in terms of career aspirations. Also GIS skills learned in school are rarely used in the professional world so be ready to adapt.
Think past GIS as an industry and look at it's integration into other solutions
This goes as general career advice but say yes to opportunities.
"This goes for undergraduates, especially the one from poorer countries like me. Focus on learning the most you can for free. Only pay for a GIS course if it has an specific module that you can't get for free anywhere else."
To learn a programming lenguage (Python if possible) and be flexible about software and other tools
Try to combine your GIS interest with another interest
Try to find opportunities to volunteer your GIS skills
Try to get additional credentials to make yourself stand out
"Try your hardest to get a position in a field that you enjoy, I regret accepting the first GIS job I was offered because now I feel pigeon-holed."
"Tutorials are a poor reflection of the reality. The hard part of GIS isn't the GIS, it's getting high quality and accurate data."
"Understand more than the point and click functions, learn python"
Understand what’s behind your GUI
Understanding databases and good data management will take you far. Start learning Python. 
use it as a tool within a field of study
We need more people of color in the fields of remote sensing and GIS to represent diverse ideas and push innovation.
"When searching for jobs, look for more than one specific field. Lots of different types of companies are looking for GIS now."
"While grinding through the entry level digitizing roles get a personal license and try every type of GIS work. Databases, scripting, model builder, cartography to find what kind of role you want to grow into and have a base familiarity with many GIS workflows for future interviews."
Work on communication skills the most as jobs want the person who can explain how or why the maps/data are presented more so than just a quiet analyst in the corner. 
Work on projects that you are passionate about. Tutorials will only get you so far. Having a portfolio of your work will do a lot to impress potential employers. 
Work on your soft skills!
"Working in a small shop will require you to wear many hats, which will give you a lot of experience fast. "
"You can view GIS as either a tool or a career. As a tool you need to study other fields like Environmental science, Water resources etc. As a Career you need to integrate GIS with Computer science domain "
You need to find a subject area that you enjoy to specialize in
You need to more than just ArcMap to work in this profession.
"Your first job doesn't have to be straight ""GIS"""
